<h1>Mesos</h1>
<h2>Architecture</h2>

![mesos-architecture.jpg]({{ site.url }}/images/mesos/mesos-architecture.jpg)

   The above figure shows the main components of Mesos. Mesos consists of a ***master*** daemon that manages ***slave*** daemons running on each cluster node, and ***Master framework*** that run ***tasks*** on these slaves.
   The Mesos master works with its slaves to determine each node's available resources, aggregates all reported available resources across all nodes, and offers them to frameworks that have registered with the master as a client. Frameworks can choose to accept or reject resources offers from the master based on the requirements of the application using that frameworks. Once offers are accepted, the master coordinates with the framworks and the slaves to schedule tasks on the participating nades and to execute them in containers so that multiple types of tasks, such a Hadoop and Cassandram, can run simultaneously on the same nodes.

<h2>Frameworks</h2>
   Apache Mesos is offen explained as being a kernel for data-centre, meaning that cluster resources (CPU, GPU, RAM, Disk...) are tracked ad offered to "user space" programs(i.e Frameworks) to do computations on the cluster.
   From the above figure <Mesos-Architecture>, we have one elected master that track resources on slaves and offer these resources to frameworks. Frameworks can take the offers and use this to launch a task on the slaves. These tasks run on an executor usually the built-in. Command Executor, that manages the task for us on the machine. So the framwork itself is actually a type of scheduler.
